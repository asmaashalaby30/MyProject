                                                People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives

                                                living
                                                in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are
                                                worried about the
                                                disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example,
                                                towards Chinese or
                                                other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine.

                                                Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a
                                                place, or a
                                                nation.
                                                Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19
                                                spreads, a need to
                                                blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads
                                                rumors and
                                                myths.

                                                Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in
                                                people, and
                                                others,
                                                such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely,

                                                person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread

                                                Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person
                                                through
                                                respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support
                                                transmission of
                                                COVID-19
                                                associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to
                                                always wash
                                                your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety.

                                                the
                                                day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or
                                                going to the
                                                bathroom.

                                                It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface
                                                or object
                                                that

                                                this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

                                                illness, is
                                                happening in adults of working age and older adults. If there cases of

                                                Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person
                                                through
                                                respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support
                                                transmission of
                                                COVID-19
                                                associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to
                                                always wash
                                                your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety.
                                                Throughout
                                                the
                                                day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or
                                                going to the
                                                bathroom.

                                                It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface
                                                or object
                                                that
                                                has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly
                                                their eyes,
                                                but
                                                this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

                                                In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on

                                                against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you

                                                viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur

                                                Researchers are
                                                trying
                                                to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their
                                                efforts.
